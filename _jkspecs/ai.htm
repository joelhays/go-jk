</P>
<P>AI files stand for &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; and mean what they
stand for. These files actually determine the behavour of the things in the game
(like, enemies, pedestrians, droids, smaller machines like AT-ST). In these
files, it is definded how &quot;tough&quot; an opponent shoots, if he can open
doors; if he wanders around or not.</P>
<P>There are 3 types of AI files for 3 difficulty levels. If a level is played
on Easy, JK automatically uses files with the &quot;.AI0&quot; extension. On
Hard, the &quot;.AI2&quot; files are used. On Medium (and if there are no extra
AI0 &amp; AI2 files), the .AI files are used.</P>
<P>The AI files do not influence the outward appearence of an enemy, nor they
define which weapons a character has . They only specify the character of the
character (and his weapons).</P>
<P>AI files consist of 2 parts. The first defines the character's basic
properties like how far it can see or from how high a height he can jump down.
The second one defines the &quot;Instincts&quot; of a character. This one is a
list of certain instincts which all have specific arguments.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="a_header"></A><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">AI Files Header</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>An AI file header is normally preceeded by a commented passage which
describes whom this specific AI belongs to and who wrote it. You can create
comments by putting the &quot;#&quot; character at the beginning of a line.</P>
<P>Here is the example of how an AI header looks like. The only line used by JK
is the last one.</P>

<P>The last line is needed by JK. It determines the properties of the
character. The properties are following each other, separated by a comma. In
MotS, there is a further property: accuracy.</P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">AI Files Instincts</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>The header is followed by a list of the character's instincts. Instincts are
the abilities of the character and also the specifications of his special
behaviour like shooting, roaming or opening doors. Most instincts need a number
of arguments which are numbers separated by commas. There are also instincts
without arguments. The list of the instincts you will find in the menu to the
left.</P></BODY></HTML>
