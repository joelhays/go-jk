<UL>
<LI>Line number labels the cutscene or level definition. Make sure that each definition has a unique line number. Note also that the first cutscene should have line number 10: because this will be played as soon as you start a new game.
<LI>CD identifies which CD the level or cutscene is on (either 1 or 2). This is so the game knows where to look for the level or cutscene.
<LI>Type is pretty obvious : CUT for a cutscene, or LEVEL for a level.
<LI>File is the name of the cutscene's or level's file.
<LI>Lightpow and Darkpow identify the powers that you will recieve upon successful completion of the level. See the list below
<LI>gotoA and gotoB refer to the next line to go to after the current level or cutscene has finished. gotoB is used when there is more than one option - for example, when you have made the decision to join either the Light side or the Dark side. Otherwise, it's value is -1.
